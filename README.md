# GNSS-Visualiser-Release-Only

Welcome to my GNSS Visualiser app. Hopefully you find this to be a fun way to learn about Global Navigation Satellite Systems.

Go to "releases" and download the executable like you would any other app.

WASD keys navigate around the earth, space bar pauses/plays the orbital animation, and the mouse wheel zooms in/out.

You can toggle the satellites, the receiver, the orbital ellipses, the trilateration spheres and circles, and the lines of sight to the satellites. 
Note that the last few only make sense when there is a both receiver and a satellite. 
YUMA files can be imported and instantly visualised as satellite constellations.
Scenarios can be saved and opened later, preserving your constellation set-up.
A slider controls the speed of the simulation.

The buttons are used to add satellites, view the status of current satellites, alter the position of the receiver, and perform analysis on global coverage

Happy navigating,

Adam
